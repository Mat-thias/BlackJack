The algorithm of the game is:
When a game starts, a table is created with its shoe, the dealer, a list of players.
The first serve is done, a pair of cards to the players and a single card to the dealer.
Check for any of the player has a blackjack and pay him/her out immediately if the dealer's first card is not an ace 
or they allow them to decide on blackjack.
Let the rest of the player decide their moves on each hand.
A player can have more than one hand if he/she splits.
After all players who have not burst, or surrender are standing, let the dealer draw till 17 or more.
Pay insurance off.
Then pay all active players; Payment could negative for loses.
    
NOTE:
    Every player starts a balance of $1000.00
    The project is still under development.
